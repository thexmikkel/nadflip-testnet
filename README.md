# NadFlip

[https://nadflip.com](https://nadflip.com)
NadFlip is a decentralized coinflip game deployed on the Monad Testnet. It features fair randomness using Pyth Entropy, a growing jackpot pool, live player stats, and a responsive frontend interface. This project is intended for demonstration and testing purposes only.

## Features

- Verifiable randomness through [Pyth Entropy](https://docs.pyth.network/entropy)
- Jackpot win triggered by rolling exactly 888
- Player statistics and recent flip history
- Responsive frontend with multi-wallet support via Reown AppKit
- Transparent fee structure and open smart contract logic

## How it works

Players place a bet and guess whether the roll will be high (â‰¥500) or low (<500). When a player submits a flip:
1. A portion of the bet (currently 0.8%) is added to the jackpot pool.
2. A small dev fee (0.2%) is deducted.
3. A request is sent to Pyth Entropy for a random number.
4. Once the random number is returned, the outcome is determined.
5. If the player guessed correctly, they receive a payout based on the bet amount.
6. If the result is exactly 888, the player also receives the full jackpot.

All events are recorded on-chain and visible through the frontend UI.

## Contracts

The main contract is `NadflipPyth.sol`, located in the `contracts/` directory.  
It handles bet validation, RNG interaction, payout logic, jackpot tracking, and player stats.
